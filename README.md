## Built using React

I built this project using create-react-app and an api: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

## Project use

This project is a quiz that gives you multiple choice questions which you can decide how many questions you want, the category to take the test on,
and how hard the difficulty is.

There is a max amount of questions per category, difficulty, etc so if you put more than the amount of questions offered
the quiz will start only with the amount of questions that is offered, if another error occurs then a page will pop up saying
there was a problem retrieving the data, either the api is down or it didn't work correctly to start the quiz and says the amount of
questions that are offered for each category.

## How to start

Clone the repository, install all necessities in order to run react on your local machine, and run it.
Then just follow the instructions as prompted to start the quiz.

## Why this was built

This project was built when I was learning react and it's to test out what I learned from react and using the data via fetching
